                    Falco Corporation was founded in the United Arab Emirates in 2021 with a clear ambition — to establish a strong presence in the global oil and gas trading industry.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    From the start, our focus has been on building a business that combines reliable trading with efficient logistics, storage, and shipping solutions. Within a short span, we expanded our reach beyond the UAE, establishing operations across Asia, the Middle East, North and South America, and Africa. This growth reflects our ability to navigate complex markets and build strong partnerships that stand the test of time.

                    Though Falco is a young company, our strength lies in the experience of our people. Our leadership and team together bring over 60 years of combined expertise in global energy trading, logistics, and supply chain management. This legacy of knowledge and industry know-how ensures that every decision we make is guided by deep understanding and proven capability.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Today, Falco continues to grow with the same entrepreneurial spirit that defined our beginnings — committed to meeting the evolving needs of the energy market and creating long-term value for our partners worldwide.
